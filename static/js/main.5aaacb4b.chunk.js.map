The anomalous property of SCP-987-GPT manifests upon the entrance of any living human beings within a 6.4 meter radius. Upon entrance, all living human beings within the radius experience a complete loss of memory of all persons present within the radius, including themselves. Subjects also experience a complete loss of any and all knowledge pertaining to their identities, their names, their places of birth, their jobs, their families, their friends, and all other personal and familial information.
